Observations on Heroes Of Pymoli

The most profitable items are generally more correlated by item price rather than
number of items sold. "Volume" doesn't seem to make it as profitable as higher price.

The percent of the total purchases by gender lines up well with genders of the player base.
That is to say, for example, 14% of the player base reported female, but that is also close 
to the percent amount of total purchases made by females (15%)

The overwhelming percentage of the player base purchases come between the ages of 15 and 30
with most concentrated between the ages of 20-24.
